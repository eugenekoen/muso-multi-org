            <h2>Hey there! Welcome to the app.</h2>
            <p>If you’ve ever walked onto a stage only to realize you’ve lost your chord sheet or that the song is in a
                key you aren't prepared for, you’re not alone. As a musician, I’ve been there—and that’s exactly why I
                built <strong>Music In His Name</strong>.</p>

            <p>What began as a personal hobby to help me stay organized has grown into a passion project: a dedicated
                app designed specifically for church bands to manage their setlists and music digitally.</p>

            <div class="story-box" style="font-style: normal;">
                <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2c3e50; font-size: 16px;">Why I built this:</h3>
                <p>I’m the type of person who needs to see the chords clearly when I play. I found that transposing on
                    the fly often led to mistakes, and paper copies were far too easy to lose. Using reliable
                    open-source technology, I’ve developed a platform that allows you to:</p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li><strong>Transpose Instantly:</strong> Change keys on the fly to match your worship leader’s
                        preference for the week.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Setlists:</strong> Easily add, remove, and reorder songs for any service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complete Customization:</strong> Edit and store your songs digitally so they are ready
                        whenever you are.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>This journey wouldn't have been possible without the feedback from my muso friends over the years—with a
                very special thanks to my uncle, Peter, for his invaluable insights.</p>

            <p>My heart behind this is to make the technical side of worship seamless so we can focus on what truly
                matters.</p>
